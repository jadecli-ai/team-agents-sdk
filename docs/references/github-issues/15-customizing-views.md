# Customizing Views in Your Project

> Source: https://docs.github.com/en/issues/planning-and-tracking-with-projects/customizing-views-in-your-project

## Overview

You can create multiple views to look at your project from different angles, deciding which items to show and how to present them.

## Main Sections

### 1. Changing the Layout of a View

Your project supports three distinct presentation modes:

- **Table Layout**: View your project as a high-density table, as a kanban board, or as a timeline-style roadmap
- **Board Layout**: Kanban-style organization
- **Roadmap Layout**: Timeline visualization

Select your preferred layout based on your project management workflow and team preferences.

### 2. Customizing the Table Layout

You can use the table layout to build a spreadsheet using your project's items, GitHub metadata, and your custom fields.

The table view functions similarly to spreadsheet software, allowing you to organize and display your project data in columnar format with full access to standard GitHub fields and any custom fields you've created.

### 3. Customizing the Board Layout

You can use the board layout to arrange your project's items over customizable columns.

The board view enables Kanban-style workflow management where items move across customizable status columns that you define for your project.

### 4. Customizing the Roadmap Layout

You can use the roadmap layout to view your project's items on a timeline.

The timeline view presents your project items chronologically, helping teams visualize schedules and dependencies across time periods.

### 5. Filtering Projects

Use filters to choose which items appear in your project's views.

Filters allow you to control which project items display in any view, enabling focused work on specific subsets of your project based on criteria you establish.

### 6. Managing Your Views

Learn how to create, save, and manage your project views.

Create multiple saved views with different configurations, layouts, and filters to support various team workflows and reporting needs.
