# Managing Labels

> Source: https://docs.github.com/en/issues/using-labels-and-milestones-to-track-work/managing-labels

## About Labels

You can organize work on GitHub by creating labels to categorize issues, pull requests, and discussions. Labels exist within the repository where they're created and can be applied to any issue, pull request, or discussion in that repository. Changes to labels in one repository don't affect labels in other repositories.

## About Default Labels

GitHub automatically includes default labels in new repositories to help establish consistent workflows:

| Label | Description |
|-------|-------------|
| `bug` | Indicates an unexpected problem or unintended behavior |
| `documentation` | Indicates a need for improvements or additions to documentation |
| `duplicate` | Indicates similar issues, pull requests, or discussions |
| `enhancement` | Indicates new feature requests |
| `good first issue` | Indicates a good issue for first-time contributors |
| `help wanted` | Indicates that a maintainer wants help on an issue or pull request |
| `invalid` | Indicates that an issue, pull request, or discussion is no longer relevant |
| `question` | Indicates that an issue, pull request, or discussion needs more information |
| `wontfix` | Indicates that work won't continue on an issue, pull request, or discussion |

Default labels can be edited or deleted after repository creation. Issues tagged with "good first issue" populate the repository's contribute page. Organization owners can customize default labels for their repositories' settings.
