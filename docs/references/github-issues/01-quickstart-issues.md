# Quickstart for GitHub Issues

> Source: https://docs.github.com/en/issues/tracking-your-work-with-issues/learning-about-issues/quickstart

## Introduction

This guide demonstrates how to use GitHub Issues to plan and track work. You'll create a new issue, break it into sub-issues, and add labels, issue types, milestones, assignees, and projects to communicate metadata.

## Prerequisites

To create an issue, you need:
- A repository with write access, or ability to create a new one
- Issues must be enabled on the repository

For repository creation help, see the documentation on creating new repositories. If issues are disabled, refer to the guide on enabling features.

## Opening a Blank Issue

To create an issue through the GitHub UI:

1. Navigate to your repository's main page
2. Click the **Issues** tab in the horizontal navigation bar
3. Select **New issue**
4. If your repository uses templates, click **Open a blank issue** to start fresh

(Other methods exist for creating issues beyond the UI approach shown here.)

## Filling in Information

Provide a descriptive title that conveys the issue's purpose at a glance.

Add a detailed description explaining:
- The issue's purpose
- Relevant context for resolution
- For bug reports: reproduction steps, expected behavior, actual behavior

Markdown formatting is supported for adding structure, links, emojis, and styling. Full formatting options are available in the Writing on GitHub documentation.

## Adding a Task List

Use plain text to track tasks without corresponding issues. These can be converted to issues later if needed. See the task lists documentation for full syntax details.

## Assigning the Issue

Communicate responsibility by assigning the issue to organization members. This clarifies who will work on it. Reference the detailed assignment documentation for more information.

## Adding Labels

Categorize issues with labels (e.g., "question," "good first issue"). This enables filtering to find all issues with specific labels.

You can use default labels or create custom ones. Management documentation covers creating and organizing labels.

## Adding Issue Types

Classify work across your organization by assigning issue types. This helps standardize how different kinds of work are tracked.

See the organization issue type management guide for configuration details.

## Adding the Issue to a Project

Add the issue to existing projects and populate associated metadata. This integrates your issue with broader project planning tools.

Detailed project documentation covers creation, management, and best practices.

## Adding Milestones

Use milestones to track issues as part of date-based targets. Milestones display progress as target dates approach, supporting timeline-based planning.

Detailed milestone documentation covers creation and progress tracking.

## Submitting Your Issue

Click **Submit new issue** to create the issue. All previously filled fields remain editable after creation. Your issue receives a unique URL for sharing with team members or referencing in other issues and pull requests.

## Adding Sub-Issues

Break larger work into smaller issues using sub-issues. This creates hierarchies on GitHub, supporting multiple levels of detail matching your team's needs.

Documentation covers both adding and browsing sub-issues in detail.

## Adding Issue Dependencies

Define blocking relationships between issues. Dependencies identify which issues are blocked by or blocking other work, supporting sequential planning.

See the issue dependencies documentation for implementation details.

## Communicating

After creation, continue conversations through comments. Mention collaborators or teams using "@" notation to draw attention to specific comments.

Link related issues in the same repository by typing "#" followed by part of an issue title, then selecting the desired issue. Full writing documentation covers all communication features.

## Next Steps

Issues support multiple use cases:
- Tracking ideas
- Collecting feedback
- Planning tasks
- Reporting bugs

For breaking issues into manageable tasks, add multiple levels of sub-issues.
