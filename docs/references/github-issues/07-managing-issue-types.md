# Managing Issue Types in an Organization

> Source: https://docs.github.com/en/issues/tracking-your-work-with-issues/using-issues/managing-issue-types-in-an-organization

## Overview

Organizations can classify and manage different types of issues across their workspace. GitHub allows creating up to 25 custom issue types that team members can apply to issues, facilitating better issue discovery and work planning.

**Default Issue Types:**
Every organization includes three pre-configured types: task, bug, and feature. These defaults can be edited, disabled, or deleted as needed.

**Visibility and Usage:**
When an issue type is assigned, it displays on issue lists and within individual issues. Users can filter and search by issue type, and these types integrate with project filtering and view customization.

## Permissions

Organization owners can modify issue types.

## Adding an Issue Type

### Step-by-Step Instructions

1. Navigate to your profile menu in the upper-right corner and select **Organizations**
2. Locate your organization and click **Settings**
3. In the sidebar under "Code, planning, and automation," select **Planning** then **Issue types**
4. Click **Create new type** on the right side
5. Enter a name in the "Type name" field
6. Add a descriptive explanation in the "Description" field to clarify the type's purpose
7. Choose a color from the "Color" options
8. Click **Create** to finalize

## Making Changes to Issue Types

### Editing Existing Types

You can modify the name, description, and color of any issue type.

### Steps to Edit

1. Go to your profile menu and select **Organizations**
2. Click **Settings** next to your organization
3. Under "Code, planning, and automation," select **Planning** and then **Issue types**
4. Click the menu button (three dots) next to the issue type you wish to modify
5. Select **Edit** and make your desired changes
6. Click **Save** to apply changes to name, description, or color

### Disabling or Deleting Types

**Disabling:** If you disable an issue type, it will not be shown and it won't be possible to set an issue to that type, but if you later decide to enable the issue type, it will be displayed again on any issues previously set to the issue type.

**Deleting:** If you delete an issue type, it is permanently removed.

To disable or delete, access the menu for your chosen type, navigate to the "Danger zone" section, and click **Disable** or **Delete**, then follow the confirmation prompts.
