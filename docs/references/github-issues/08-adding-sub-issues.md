> Source: https://docs.github.com/en/issues/tracking-your-work-with-issues/using-issues/adding-sub-issues

## Overview

Sub-issues allow you to break down larger work items into manageable tasks within GitHub Issues, creating hierarchical relationships between parent and child issues.

## Key Capabilities

- Add sub-issues to decompose larger work into smaller tasks
- Track relationships between parent and sub-issues across GitHub
- View parent issue and sub-issue progress in projects for filtering and grouping
- Create nested hierarchies with up to **eight levels** of sub-issues
- Add a maximum of **100 sub-issues** per parent issue

## Permissions Required

People with at least triage permissions for a repository can add sub-issues.

## Creating a New Sub-Issue

1. Navigate to the parent issue
2. Click **Create sub-issue** at the bottom of the issue description
3. Enter the sub-issue title in the dialog
4. Optionally add description, issue type, assignees, labels, projects, and milestones
5. Select **Create more sub-issues** if continuing to add multiple sub-issues
6. Click **Create**

## Adding an Existing Issue as a Sub-Issue

To link an existing issue as a sub-issue:

1. Go to the parent issue
2. Click the dropdown menu icon next to **Create sub-issue**
3. Select **Add existing issue**
4. Choose an issue by:
   - Selecting from suggestions
   - Searching by title or issue number
   - Switching repositories to find issues elsewhere

This feature enables comprehensive project tracking and visual representation of work hierarchies within GitHub's issue management system.
