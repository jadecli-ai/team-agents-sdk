> Source: https://docs.github.com/en/issues/planning-and-tracking-with-projects/understanding-fields

## Overview

Learn about the different fields and custom field types, how to add fields to your project, and how to manage custom fields.

## Field Types Available

### 1. Text and Number Fields

You can add custom text and number fields to your project. These basic field types allow you to store alphanumeric data and numerical values for project items.

### 2. Date Fields

You can create custom date fields that can be set by typing a date or using a calendar. Date fields enable temporal tracking, with flexible input methods for scheduling and deadline management.

### 3. Single Select Fields

You can create single select fields with multiple options, each with a description and a color, that can be selected from a dropdown menu. These fields provide categorical organization with visual color-coding and descriptive metadata for each option.

### 4. Iteration Fields

You can create iterations to plan upcoming work and group items. Iterations facilitate sprint planning and time-boxed work organization within projects.

### 5. Parent Issue and Sub-Issue Progress Fields

You can show an issue's parent issue and view sub-issue progress in your projects. These relational fields display hierarchical relationships and track completion status across issue families.

### 6. Pull Request Fields

You can show a linked pull request and the pull request reviewers in your projects. Display PR connections and reviewer information directly within your project view.

### 7. Issue Type Field

You can show the type of the issue in your projects. Categorize issues by type for better organizational visibility and tracking.

## Field Management

### Renaming Custom Fields

You can rename existing custom fields in your project to better reflect their purpose.
