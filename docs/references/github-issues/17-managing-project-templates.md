# Managing Project Templates in Your Organization

> Source: https://docs.github.com/en/issues/planning-and-tracking-with-projects/managing-your-project/managing-project-templates-in-your-organization

## Overview

Organizations can create and manage project templates to enable members to use pre-configured projects as starting points for their own work. This guide covers creating templates, configuring recommendations, and managing template visibility.

## Permissions

People with admin permissions for a project in an organization can set the project as a template. People with admin or write permissions for a project in an organization can copy the project and set the copied project as a template.

## About Templates

You can establish a template or designate an existing project as a template to distribute a pre-built project structure within your organization for others to use as a foundation.

Templates marked in your organization appear in the project creation dialog when members create new projects. Up to **six templates** can be designated as recommended options to highlight preferred starting points.

### What Transfers from Templates

When creating a project from a template, the following elements transfer to the new project:
- Views and layouts
- Custom fields with associated values
- Draft issues and field values
- Configured workflows (excluding auto-add workflows)
- Insights and visualizations

The template used for a project can be identified in the project's settings page under the Templates section.

## Creating a New Template

1. Click your profile picture in the upper-right corner, then select **Organizations**
2. Click your organization name
3. At the top, click **Projects**
4. In the left sidebar, click **Templates**
5. Click **New template**

## Setting an Existing Project as a Template

To convert an existing project into a reusable template:

1. Navigate to your project
2. Click the menu icon (three dots) in the top-right corner
3. Select **Settings**
4. In the Templates section, toggle "Make template" to **On**

## Finding Organization Templates

To view all available templates:

1. Click your profile picture, then select **Organizations**

Templates can also be added to specific teams and repositories for increased accessibility and visibility from those locations.

## Copying a Project as a Template

Projects with write or admin permissions can be duplicated and converted to templates simultaneously. This approach copies all project elements and designates the duplicate as a template.

1. Navigate to your project
2. Click the menu icon in the top-right corner
3. Select **Settings**
4. In the Templates section, click **Copy as template**
