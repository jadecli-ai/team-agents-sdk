# Creating Issue Dependencies

> Source: https://docs.github.com/en/issues/tracking-your-work-with-issues/using-issues/creating-issue-dependencies

## Overview

Issue dependencies let you define issues that are blocked by, or blocking, other work. This feature allows teams to track blockers and dependencies directly within GitHub Issues, making it easier to identify bottlenecks and understand workflow dependencies.

## Availability

- **Permission Level**: Triage permissions or higher required
- **Plans**: Available on GitHub Free, Pro, Team, and Enterprise Cloud

## Creating Dependencies

### Marking an Issue as Blocked or Blocking

Follow these steps to establish a dependency relationship:

1. Navigate to the specific issue where you want to create a dependency
2. In the right sidebar, select the **Relationships** section
3. Choose one of two dependency options from the dropdown:
   - **"Mark as blocked by"** - indicates your issue depends on another issue's completion
   - **"Mark as blocking"** - indicates your issue prevents another issue from being completed
4. In the resulting dialog box, search for and select all related issues

### Visual Indicators

Blocked issues are marked with a "Blocked" icon on your project boards or repository's Issues page, providing quick visual recognition of workflow bottlenecks.

## Removing Dependencies

### Changing or Clearing Relationships

To modify or remove an existing dependency:

1. Navigate to the issue with the dependency you want to change
2. Click **Relationships** in the right sidebar
3. Select from these options:
   - **"Change blocked by"** - to modify blocking dependencies
   - **"Change blocking"** - to modify blocking relationships
4. In the dialog, deselect issues that should no longer be linked

## Key Benefits

- Identifies workflow bottlenecks visually
- Clarifies task sequencing requirements
- Enables better project planning and coordination
- Provides transparency across team dependencies
