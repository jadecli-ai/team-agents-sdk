## Overview

GitHub Projects offers built-in workflows to automate your project management tasks. These workflows enable you to update item statuses based on specific events without manual intervention.

## Key Features

The platform provides automated status updates through built-in workflows. For instance, you can:

- Automatically set status to "Todo" when items are added to your project
- Close issues when their project status changes
- Set status to "Done" when issues are closed

### Default Workflows

When a project initializes, two workflows are automatically enabled:

1. **Closed issues/PRs**: When issues or pull requests are closed, their status automatically becomes "Done"
2. **Merged pull requests**: When pull requests are merged, their status automatically becomes "Done"

### Additional Automation Options

Beyond status workflows, you can configure automation to:

- Automatically archive items meeting specified criteria
- Automatically add items from repositories matching defined filters
