## Overview

The Issues and Pull Request dashboards list the open issues and pull requests you've created, as well as your saved views. These tools help you manage work across repositories and track mentions.

## Viewing Your Issues and Pull Requests

Your issue and pull request dashboards appear at the top of any GitHub page. Each dashboard lets you filter to find:
- Issues or pull requests you created
- Items assigned to you
- Content mentioning you
- Pull requests requiring your review

### Steps to Access

1. At the top of any page, click the Issues icon to view your issues, or the Pull Requests icon to view your pull requests
2. Optionally filter results or use the search bar for more specific findings
3. Reference the filtering and searching documentation for additional details

## Tracking with Saved Views

To help you better monitor and find issues and pull requests across multiple repositories, you can create saved views on the issues dashboard. You may create up to **25 saved views**.

### Creating a Saved View

1. Click the Issues icon at the top
2. In the left sidebar, next to "Views," click the plus icon
3. Enter a title, description, and custom icon
4. Under "Query," construct your search query using advanced filters
   - **Tip**: Use the `is:pr` filter to include pull requests in the saved view
5. Click **Save view**

### Editing, Duplicating, or Deleting Saved Views

1. Navigate to your issues dashboard
2. Under "Views" in the left sidebar, select the view to modify
3. Click the three-dot menu icon beside the view name
4. Choose:
   - **Edit** to modify the view
